version 1.9
Lowering the memory footprint of initialization phase

version 1.8
Experimenting with the normalization of the noise

version 1.7
This code is based on version 1.5. The noise is no longer computed from solving a system of ODE's but is instead sampled from a GP with the correct mean and covariance using FFT. 

version 1.6
Exact noise replaced by a weak approximations - This did nonsense physically will never be used

version 1.5
Major performance improvements

version 1.4
Switching over the system to the velocity memory kernel form. The resolved system is now solved with a RK3 solver instead of velocity Verlet. 

version 1.3
In version 1.2, the noise term was unnormalized while the memory term was. This violates the fluctuation dissipation theorem. In this version I normalize the noise in accordance with the fluctuation dissipation theorem. 


version 1.2

Added support to truncate the memory kernel. The truncated memory kernel is normalized to have the same integral as the untruncated memory kernel on the real line. This enforces the Green-Kubo relations. 


version 1.1

This version lowered the memory footprint of the program 
by only tracking the two most recent values of the velociites 
for the simulated particles.

The previous version tracked all the velocities of all the particles
at all times and required much to large of a memory footprint.
